/**
 * This class wraps the popup's form, and performs the proper clearing of data
 * based on the user's selections. It depends on the form containing a single
 * select element with an id of 'timeframe', and a single button with an id of
 * 'button'. When you write actual code you should probably be a little more
 * accepting of variance, but this is just a sample app. :)
 *
 * Most of this is boilerplate binding the controller to the UI. The bits that
 * specifically will be useful when using the BrowsingData API are contained in
 * `parseMilliseconds_`, `handleCallback_`, and `handleClick_`.
